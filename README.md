Hi, I am **Vilmos Kintera** from Budapest, Hungary.

I have been working with **Microsoft Dynamics Axapta / AX / Dynamics 365 Finance and Supply Chain Management** ERP systems since 2003.


The handle comes from my fascination with technology on a low level: RunBase classes for Dynamics AX are among those, so it became: @DAXRunBase


I am interested in ERP software development and surrounding technologies, to name a few:
- Microsoft Azure and cloud-hosted technologies
- PowerShell scripting
- Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
- Automations (build and release management, monitoring, etc.)
- Improving the toolset for Visual Studio X++ / C# development and creating SQL Server monitoring tools


I recently began to study at University of London's new World Class online course in order to finish my Bachelor in Science Degree. The curriculum introduces adoption of a lot of current, very relevant advanced technologies which I am interested in next to my dayjob.
