Hi, I am **Vilmos Kintera** from Budapest, Hungary.

I have been working with **Microsoft Dynamics AX (formerly Axapta)** on-premises, then later on **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Supply Chain Management** cloud ERP systems since 2003.


The handle comes from my fascination with technology on a deep level: RunBase classes for Dynamics are among those, so I chose @DAXRunBase


I am interested in ERP software development and surrounding technologies, to name a few:
- Improving the toolset for Visual Studio X++ / C# development and creating SQL Server monitoring tools
- Microsoft Azure and cloud-hosted technologies
- PowerShell scripting
- Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
- Automations (build and release management, monitoring, etc.)


I recently began to study at <img src="./University_of_London_coat_of_arms.svg" width=15px> **University of London**'s new World Class to finish my Bachelor in Science Degree. The curriculum introduces adoption of a lot of current, very exciting and relevant advanced technologies.
